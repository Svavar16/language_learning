# Language learning

## this here is a method that I use to learn languages

while creating whole lot of smaller project, I tend to get more confident on how to use it  
and I understand the basics better, so if you want to, then you can take a look at this.

this is all for web development and not the basics of the language itself, might do something like that in the future.

## the projects

I will start simple and the work on from there, first hello world, and in the end have a few minor project,  
nothing to large, but should give a basic understanding on how to do something, so later on if wanted, it's easy to look it up.

### the projects lists

- hello world
- create get, post, put, and delete routes
- have the same crud routes save into an array or map (map might be simpler for retrieving)
- connect a database
- retrieve data from a database, this might have small sql script to generate the data (or have a ready database for that, lets see)
- have all of the CRUD routes save and retrieve from a database
- more? need to think about this.
